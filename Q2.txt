Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

-It’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
-These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types such as Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol.
-They are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
-Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.

For example 
var mybike = new Object();
mybike.make = 'Royal Enfield';
mybike.model = 'classic500';
mybike.year = 2015;
