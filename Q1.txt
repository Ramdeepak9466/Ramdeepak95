Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1 
- The first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1
- It loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
- It's a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.

HTTP2
-HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. 
-It's much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
-It offers a feature called weighted prioritization. This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time.
